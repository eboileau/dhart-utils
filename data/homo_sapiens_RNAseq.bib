To test this, we performed genome-wide chromosome conformation analyses in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with a haploinsufficient mutation for lamin A/C. Compared with gene-corrected cells, mutant hiPSC-CMs have marked electrophysiological and contractile alterations, with modest gene expression changes. While large-scale changes in chromosomal topology are evident, differences in chromatin compartmentalization are limited to a few hotspots that escape segregation to the nuclear lamina and inactivation during cardiogenesis. These regions exhibit up-regulation of multiple noncardiac genes including CACNA1A, encoding for neuronal P/Q-type calcium channels. Pharmacological inhibition of the resulting current partially mitigates the electrical alterations. However, chromatin compartment changes do not explain most gene expression alterations in mutant hiPSC-CMs. Thus, global errors in chromosomal compartmentation are not the primary pathogenic mechanism in heart failure due to lamin A/C haploinsufficiency.}},

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) provide great opportunities for mechanistic dissection of human cardiac pathophysiology; however, hiPSC-CMs remain immature relative to the adult heart. To identify novel signaling pathways driving the maturation process during heart development, we analyzed published transcriptional and epigenetic datasets from hiPSC-CMs and prenatal and postnatal human hearts. These analyses revealed that several components of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways are downregulated in the postnatal heart. Here, we show that dual inhibition of these pathways for only 5 days significantly enhances the maturation of day 30 hiPSC-CMs in many domains: hypertrophy, multinucleation, metabolism, T-tubule density, calcium handling, and electrophysiology, many equivalent to day 60 hiPSC-CMs. These data indicate that the MAPK/PI3K/AKT pathways are involved in cardiomyocyte maturation and provide proof of concept for the manipulation of key signaling pathways for optimal hiPSC-CM maturation, a critical aspect of faithful in vitro modeling of cardiac pathologies and subsequent drug discovery.},

However, the current use of complex reprogramming vectors for the activation of reparative pathways challenges the easy translation of these therapies into the clinic. Here, we evaluated the response of mouse neonatal and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, thus mimicking the metabolic environment of the fetal heart. An increase in cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity was observed in the presence of lactate, as determined through Ki67 and Aurora-B kinase. Gene expression and RNA-sequencing data revealed that cardiomyocytes incubated with lactate showed upregulation of BMP10, LIN28 or TCIM in tandem with downregulation of GRIK1 or DGKK among others. Lactate also demonstrated a capability to modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines on cardiac fibroblasts, reducing the production of Fas, Fraktalkine or IL-12p40, while stimulating IL-13 and SDF1a. In addition, the generation of a lactate-rich environment improved ex vivo neonatal heart culture, by affecting the contractile activity and sarcomeric structures and inhibiting epicardial cell spreading. Our results also suggested a common link between the effect of lactate and the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. These findings support a novel use of lactate in cardiac tissue engineering, modulating the metabolic environment of the heart and thus paving the way to the development of lactate-releasing platforms for in situ cardiac regeneration.},

  abstract = {Abstract Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetic disease associated with sudden cardiac death and cardiac fibro-fatty replacement. Over the last years, several works have demonstrated that different epigenetic enzymes can affect not only gene expression changes in cardiac diseases but also cellular metabolism. Specifically, the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 is known to facilitate adipogenesis and modulate cardiac metabolism in heart failure. Our group previously demonstrated that human primary cardiac stromal cells (CStCs) contribute to adipogenesis in the ACM pathology. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the role of GCN5 in ACM intracellular lipid accumulation. To do so, CStCs were obtained from right ventricle biopsies of ACM patients and from samples of healthy cadaveric donors (CTR). GCN5 expression was increased both in ex vivo and in vitro ACM samples compared to CTR. When GCN5 expression was silenced or pharmacologically inhibited by the administration of MB-3, we observed a reduction in lipid accumulation and a mitigation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in ACM CStCs. In agreement, transcriptome analysis revealed that the presence of MB-3 modified the expression of pathways related to cellular redox balance. Altogether, our findings suggest that GCN5 inhibition reduces fat accumulation in ACM CStCs, partially by modulating intracellular redox balance pathways.},

  abstract     = {Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is the most lethal congenital heart disease (CHD). The pathogenesis of HLHS is poorly understood and due to the likely oligogenic complexity of the disease, definitive HLHS-causing genes have not yet been identified. Postulating that impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation as a likely important contributing mechanism to HLHS pathogenesis, and we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify genes affecting proliferation of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). This yielded ribosomal protein (RP) genes as the most prominent class of effectors of CM proliferation. In parallel, whole genome sequencing and rare variant filtering of a cohort of 25 HLHS proband-parent trios with poor clinical outcome revealed enrichment of rare variants of RP genes. In addition, in another familial CHD case of HLHS proband we identified a rare, predicted-damaging promoter variant affecting RPS15A that was shared between the proband and a distant relative with CHD. Functional testing with an integrated multi-model system approach reinforced the idea that RP genes are major regulators of cardiac growth and proliferation, thus potentially contributing to hypoplastic phenotype observed in HLHS patients. Cardiac knockdown (KD) of RP genes with promoter or coding variants (RPS15A, RPS17, RPL26L1, RPL39, RPS15) reduced proliferation in generic hPSC-CMs and caused malformed hearts, heart-loss or even lethality in Drosophila. In zebrafish, diminished rps15a function caused reduced CM numbers, heart looping defects, or weakened contractility, while reduced rps17 or rpl39 function caused reduced ventricular size or systolic atrial dysfunction, respectively. Importantly, genetic interactions between RPS15A and core cardiac transcription factors TBX5 in CMs, Drosocross, pannier and tinman in flies, and tbx5 and nkx2-7 (nkx2-5 paralog) in fish, support a specific role for RP genes in heart development. Furthermore, RPS15A KD-induced heart/CM proliferation defects were significantly attenuated by p53 KD in both hPSC-CMs and zebrafish, and by Hippo activation (YAP/yorkie overexpression) in developing fly hearts. Based on these findings, we conclude that RP genes play critical roles in cardiogenesis and constitute an emerging novel class of gene candidates likely involved in HLHS and other CHDs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant from the Wanek Foundation at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, M.N., to J.L.T., T.J.N., T.M.O., R.B. and A.R.C.

Moreover, patients with more than one independent HCM mutation may be at increased risk for more severe disease expression and adverse outcomes. However detailed mechanistic understanding, especially at early stages of disease progression, is limited. To identify early-stage HCM triggers, we generated single (MYH7 c.2167C > T [R723C] with a known pathogenic significance in the MHC converter domain) and double (MYH7 c.2167C > T [R723C]; MYH6 c.2173C > T [R725C] with unknown significance) myosin gene mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a base-editing strategy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from hiPSCs with either single or double mutation exhibited phenotypic characteristics consistent with later-stage HCM including hypertrophy, multinucleation, altered calcium handling, metabolism, and arrhythmia. We then probed mutant CMs at time points prior to the detection of known HCM characteristics. We found MYH7/MYH6 dual mutation dysregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, altered integrin expression, and interrupted cell-ECM adhesion by limiting the formation of focal adhesions. These results point to a new phenotypic feature of early-stage HCM and reveal novel therapeutic avenues aimed to delay or prohibit disease onset.},

Human myocardium could be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 gene-induced injury and dysfunction of human CMs remain elusive. Here, we find overexpression of three SARS-CoV-2 coding genes, Nsp6, Nsp8 and M, could globally compromise transcriptome of hPSC-CMs. Integrated transcriptomic analyses of hPSC-CMs infected by SARS-CoV-2 with hPSC-CMs of Nsp6, Nsp8 or M overexpression identified concordantly activated genes enriched into apoptosis and immune/inflammation responses, whereas reduced genes related to heart contraction and functions. Further, Nsp6, Nsp8 or M overexpression induce prominent apoptosis and electrical dysfunctions of hPSC-CMs. Global interactome analysis find Nsp6, Nsp8 and M all interact with ATPase subunits, leading to significantly reduced cellular ATP level of hPSC-CMs. Finally, we find two FDA-approved drugs, ivermectin and meclizine, could enhance the ATP level, and ameliorate cell death and dysfunctions of hPSC-CMs overexpressing Nsp6, Nsp8 or M. Overall, we uncover the global detrimental impacts of SARS-CoV-2 genes Nsp6, Nsp8 and M on the whole transcriptome and interactome of hPSC-CMs, define the crucial role of ATP level reduced by SARS-CoV-2 genes in CM death and functional abnormalities, and explore the potentially pharmaceutical approaches to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 genes-induced CM injury and abnormalities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We recapitulated cytopathic features of SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiac damage and monitored the course of cardiac complications after infection, which is critically important to develop therapeutics.

Therapeutics potential towards myocardial injury was further developed in our tissue model. We evaluated cardioprotective effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from hiPSC source on the infected tissues, indicating that EVs alleviated the impairment of contractile force and cardiac cell death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that enriched microRNA in hiPSC-EVs can modulate cardiac-specific processes. These findings suggested that cardiac manifestations examined from tissues models provided insights into cardiac injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and model systems allow the investigation of mechanisms driving cardiac dysfunction and iPSC-EVs served as a promising therapy to rescue cardiac damage from infection.

  abstract  = {Pericytes (PCs) are abundant yet remain the most enigmatic and ill-defined cell population in the heart. Here, we investigated whether PCs can be reprogrammed to aid neovascularization. Primary PCs from human and mouse hearts acquired cytoskeletal proteins typical of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) upon exclusion of EGF/bFGF, which signal through ERK1/2, or upon exposure to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Differentiated PCs became more proangiogenic, more responsive to vasoactive agents, and insensitive to chemoattractants. RNA sequencing revealed transcripts marking the PD0325901-induced transition into proangiogenic, stationary VSMC-like cells, including the unique expression of 2 angiogenesis-related markers, aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and cellular retinoic acid–binding protein 2 (CRABP2), which were further verified at the protein level. This enabled us to trace PCs during in vivo studies. In mice, implantation of Matrigel plugs containing human PCs plus PD0325901 promoted the formation of αSMA+ neovessels compared with PC only. Two-week oral administration of PD0325901 to mice increased the heart arteriolar density, total vascular area, arteriole coverage by PDGFRβ+AQP1+CRABP2+ PCs, and myocardial perfusion. Short-duration PD0325901 treatment of mice after myocardial infarction enhanced the peri-infarct vascularization, reduced the scar, and improved systolic function. In conclusion, myocardial PCs have intrinsic plasticity that can be pharmacologically modulated to promote reparative vascularization of the ischemic heart.},

We applied a combinatorial engineering approach, which integrated multiple physiological cues, including metabolic conditioning and electrical stimulation, to generate mature iPSC-aCMs. Using the patient’s own atrial tissue as a gold standard benchmark, we assessed the electrophysiological, structural, metabolic, and molecular maturation of iPSC-aCMs. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis and inference from gene regulatory networks identified key gene expression pathways and transcription factors mediating atrial development and maturation. Only mature iPSC-aCMs generated from patients with heritable AF carrying the non-ion channel gene (NPPA) mutation showed enhanced expression and function of a cardiac potassium channel and revealed mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction. Collectively, we propose that ion channel remodeling in conjunction with metabolic defects created an electrophysiological substrate for AF. Overall, our electro-metabolic approach generated mature human iPSC-aCMs that unmasked the underlying mechanism of the first non-ion channel gene, NPPA, that causes AF. Our maturation approach will allow for the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of heritable AF and the development of personalized therapies.},

  abstract  = {Background: Although many pathological changes have been
               associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD), molecular-level
               alterations specific to the ischemic myocardium and their
               potential to reflect disease severity or therapeutic outcome
               remain unclear. Currently, diagnosis occurs relatively late and
               evaluating disease severity is largely based on clinical
               symptoms, various imaging modalities, or the determination of
               risk factors. This study aims to identify IHD-associated
               signature RNAs from the atrial myocardium and evaluate their
               ability to reflect disease severity or cardiac surgery outcomes.
               Methods and Results: We collected right atrial appendage (RAA)
               biopsies from 40 patients with invasive coronary angiography
               (ICA)-positive IHD undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery and
               from 8 patients ICA-negative for IHD (non-IHD) undergoing
               valvular surgery. Following RNA sequencing, RAA transcriptomes
               were analyzed against 429 donors from the GTEx project without
               cardiac disease. The IHD transcriptome was characterized by
               repressed RNA expression in pathways for cell-cell contacts and
               mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased expressions of the CSRNP3,
               FUT10, SHD, NAV2-AS4, and hsa-mir-181 genes resulted in
               significance with the complexity of coronary artery obstructions
               or correlated with a functional cardiac benefit from bypass
               surgery. Conclusions: Our results provide an atrial
               myocardium-focused insight into IHD signature RNAs. The specific
               gene expression changes characterized here, pave the way for
               future disease mechanism-based identification of biomarkers for
               early detection and treatment of IHD.},

  abstract = {Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease which to date is incurable. The major cause of death is dilated cardiomyopathy however, its pathogenesis is unclear as existing cellular and animal models do not fully recapitulate the human disease phenotypes. In this study, we generated cardiac organoids from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (DMD-COs) and isogenic-corrected controls (DMD-Iso-COs) and studied if DMD-related cardiomyopathy and disease progression occur in the organoids upon long-term culture (up to 93 days). Histological analysis showed that DMD-COs lack initial proliferative capacity, displayed a progressive loss of sarcoglycan localization and high stress in endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, cardiomyocyte deterioration, fibrosis and aberrant adipogenesis were observed in DMD-COs over time. RNA sequencing analysis confirmed a distinct transcriptomic profile in DMD-COs which was associated with functional enrichment in hypertrophy/dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, adipogenesis and fibrosis pathways. Moreover, five miRNAs were identified to be crucial in this dysregulated gene network. In conclusion, we generated patient-derived cardiac organoid model that displayed DMD-related cardiomyopathy and disease progression phenotypes in long-term culture. We envision the feasibility to develop a more complex, realistic and reliable in vitro 3D human cardiac-mimics to study DMD-related cardiomyopathies.},

  abstract = {Summary
Regeneration of injured human heart muscle is limited and an unmet clinical need. There are no methods for the reproducible generation of clinical-quality stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). We identified laminin-221 (LN-221) as the most likely expressed cardiac laminin. We produced it as human recombinant protein and showed that LN-221 promotes differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward cardiomyocyte lineage and downregulates pluripotency and teratoma-associated genes. We developed a chemically defined, xeno-free laminin-based differentiation protocol to generate CVPs. We show high reproducibility of the differentiation protocol using time-course bulk RNA sequencing developed from different hESC lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CVPs derived from hESC lines supported reproducibility and identified three main progenitor subpopulations. These CVPs were transplanted into myocardial infarction mice, where heart function was measured by echocardiogram and human heart muscle bundle formation was identified histologically. This method may provide clinical-quality cells for use in regenerative cardiology.},
