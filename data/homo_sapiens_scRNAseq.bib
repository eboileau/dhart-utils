  abstract = {Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene SLC22A5, encoding for the plasmalemmal carnitine transporter OCTN2. PCD patients suffer from muscular weakness and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, currently available PCD models were unable to distinguish causative from secondary pathomechanisms. To further understand the contribution of cellular subclusters to the PCD disease phenotype we analyzed engineered heart tissues from OCTN2-defective genotype in comparison to isogenic control using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Two OCTN2-defective human induced pluripotent stem cell lines were generated from a healthy control line, carrying a full OCTN2-knockout and a homozygous OCTN2 (N32S) loss of function mutation. Cardiomyocytes were differentiated and the engineered heart tissue (EHT) technology served as a three-dimensional disease model. EHTs were cultured for 14 days and subsequently analyzed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing.},

  abstract = {Cardiac involvement is an important determinant of mortality amongst sarcoidosis patients. While granulomatous inflammation is a hallmark finding in cardiac sarcoidosis, the precise immune cell populations that comprise the granuloma remain unresolved. Furthermore, it is unclear how the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of cardiac sarcoidosis differs from other inflammatory heart diseases. We leveraged spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx DSP) and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to elucidate the cellular and transcriptional landscape of cardiac sarcoidosis. Using GeoMX DSP technology, we compared the transcriptomal profile of CD68+ rich immune cell infiltrates in human cardiac sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis, and lymphocytic myocarditis. We performed snRNAseq of human cardiac sarcoidosis to identify immune cell types and examined their transcriptomic landscape and regulation. Using multi-channel immunofluorescence staining, we validated immune cell populations identified by snRNAseq, determined their spatial relationship, and devised an immunostaining approach to distinguish cardiac sarcoidosis from other inflammatory heart diseases. Despite overlapping histological features, spatial transcriptomics identified transcriptional signatures and associated pathways that robustly differentiated cardiac sarcoidosis from giant cell myocarditis and lymphocytic myocarditis. snRNAseq revealed the presence of diverse populations of myeloid cells in cardiac sarcoidosis with distinct molecular features. We identified GPNMB as a novel marker of multinucleated giant cells and predicted that the MITF family of transcription factors regulated this cell type. We also detected additional macrophage populations in cardiac sarcoidosis including HLA-DR+ macrophages, SYTL3+ macrophages and CD163+ resident macrophages. HLA-DR+ macrophages were found immediately adjacent to GPMMB+ giant cells, a distinct feature compared with other inflammatory cardiac diseases. SYTL3+ macrophages were located scattered throughout the granuloma and CD163+ macrophages, CD1c+ dendritic cells, non-classical monocytes, and T-cells were located at the periphery and outside of the granuloma. Finally, we demonstrate mTOR pathway activation is associated with proliferation and is selectively found in HLA-DR+ and SYLT3+ macrophages. In this study, we identified diverse populations of immune cells with distinct molecular signatures that comprise the sarcoid granuloma. These findings provide new insights into the pathology of cardiac sarcoidosis and highlight opportunities to improve diagnostic testing. We performed snRNAseq of human cardiac sarcoidosis (4 samples) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (3 samples) to identify immune cell types and examined their transcriptomic landscape and regulation.},

Single-cell transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of cell composition and associated gene expression. Through integrated analysis of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data generated from 27 healthy donors and 18 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy, here we define the cell composition of the healthy and failing human heart. We identify cell-specific transcriptional signatures associated with age and heart failure and reveal the emergence of disease-associated cell states. Notably, cardiomyocytes converge toward common disease-associated cell states, whereas fibroblasts and myeloid cells undergo dramatic diversification. Endothelial cells and pericytes display global transcriptional shifts without changes in cell complexity. Collectively, our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of human heart failure, identify cell type-specific transcriptional programs and disease-associated cell states and establish a valuable resource for the investigation of human heart failure.},

To explore the underlying mechanisms of HFrEF etiology and progression, we studied the molecular and cellular differences in four chambers of non-failing (NF, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}10) and HFrEF (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}12) human hearts. We identified 333 genes enriched within NF heart subregions and often associated with cardiovascular disease GWAS variants. Expression analysis of HFrEF tissues revealed extensive disease-associated transcriptional and signaling alterations in left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV). Common left heart HFrEF pathologies included mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Oxidative stress and cardiac necrosis pathways were prominent within LV, whereas TGF-beta signaling was evident within LA. Cell type composition was estimated by deconvolution and revealed that HFrEF samples had smaller percentage of cardiomyocytes within the left heart, higher representation of fibroblasts within LA and perivascular cells within the left heart relative to NF samples. We identified essential modules associated with HFrEF pathology and linked transcriptome discoveries with human genetics findings. This study contributes to a growing body of knowledge describing chamber-specific transcriptomics and revealed genes and pathways that are associated with heart failure pathophysiology, which may aid in therapeutic target discovery.},

To understand the interplay between cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte cell types in human HCM, single nuclei RNA-sequencing was performed on myectomy specimens from HCM patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and control samples from donor hearts free of cardiovascular disease. Clustering analysis based on gene expression patterns identified a total of 34 distinct cell populations, which were classified into 10 different cell types based on marker gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis comparing HCM to Normal datasets revealed differences in sarcomere and extracellular matrix gene expression. Analysis of expressed ligand-receptor pairs across multiple cell types indicated profound alteration in HCM intercellular communication, particularly between cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, fibroblasts and lymphocytes and involving integrin $\beta$1 and its multiple extracellular matrix (ECM) cognate ligands. These findings provide a paradigm for how sarcomere dysfunction is associated with reduced cardiomyocyte secretion of ECM ligands, altered fibroblast ligand-receptor interactions with other cell types and increased fibroblast to lymphocyte signaling, which can further alter the ECM composition and promote nonmyocyte phenotypes.},

Here, we defined \&gt;287,000 cCREs in the four chambers of the human heart at single-cell resolution, which revealed cCREs and candidate transcription factors associated with cardiac cell types in a region-dependent manner and during heart failure. We further found cardiovascular disease–associated genetic variants enriched within these cCREs including 38 candidate causal atrial fibrillation variants localized to cardiomyocyte cCREs. Additional functional studies revealed that two of these variants affect a cCRE controlling KCNH2/HERG expression and action potential repolarization. Overall, this atlas of human cardiac cCREs provides the foundation for illuminating cell type–specific gene regulation in human hearts during health and disease.},

In vertebrates, GATA2 is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and is expressed throughout embryo development and in adult life. Although the essential role of GATA2 in mouse hematopoiesis is well established, its involvement during early human hematopoietic development is not clear. By combining time-controlled overexpression of GATA2 with genetic knockout experiments, we found that GATA2, at the mesoderm specification stage, promotes the generation of hemogenic endothelial progenitors and their further differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells, and negatively regulates cardiac differentiation. Surprisingly, genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that GATA2 bound to regulatory regions, and repressed the expression of cardiac development-related genes. Moreover, genes important for hematopoietic differentiation were upregulated by GATA2 in a mostly indirect manner. Collectively, our data reveal a hitherto unrecognized role of GATA2 as a repressor of cardiac fates, and highlight the importance of coordinating the specification and repression of alternative cell fates.},

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify and characterize cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues. However, extracting intact cells from tissues and organs is often technically challenging or impossible, for example in heart or brain tissue. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing provides an alternative way to obtain transcriptome profiles of such tissues. To systematically assess the differences between high-throughput single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq approaches, we compared Drop-seq and DroNc-seq, two microfluidic-based 3{\textasciiacutex} RNA capture technologies that profile total cellular and nuclear RNA, respectively, during a time course experiment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Clustering of time-series transcriptomes from Drop-seq and DroNc-seq revealed six distinct cell types, five of which were found in both techniques. Furthermore, single-cell trajectories reconstructed from both techniques reproduced expected differentiation dynamics. We then applied DroNc-seq to postmortem heart tissue to test its performance on heterogeneous human tissue samples. Our data confirm that DroNc-seq yields similar results to Drop-seq on matched samples and can be successfully used to generate reference maps for the human cell atlas.},

  abstract = {About 45% of congenital heart disease (CHD) is caused by rare gene mutations. Non-coding mutations that perturb cis-regulatory elements (CREs) likely contribute to CHD among the remaining cases without clear etiology. However, identifying CHD-causing non-coding variants has been problematic. We combined human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) differentiation and a lentivirus-mediated massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to create a high-throughput platform to measure human cardiac enhancer activity. We tested 2451 candidate human cardiac enhancers, identified 1185 with measurable activity, and functionally dissected 123 of these by systematic tiling mutagenesis. We functionally evaluated 6761 non-coding de novo variants (ncDNVs) prioritized from the whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 749 CHD trios. 397 ncDNVs significantly affected cardiac CRE activity. Remarkably, 53% of these ncDNVs increased enhancer activity, often at regions with undetectable enhancer activity in the reference sequence. We introduced 10 of these DNVs associated with CHD genes into iPSCs and found that 4 altered expression of neighboring genes. Moreover, these 4 DNVs also altered cardiomyocyte differentiation, as assessed by single nucleus RNA sequencing. Using the MPRA data, we developed a regression model to prioritize future DNVs for functional testing and demonstrate that this model finds enrichment of DNVs in a second, independent WGS cohort. Taken together, we developed a scalable system to measure the impact of non-coding DNVs on CRE activity and deployed this platform to systematically assess the contribution of non-coding DNVs to CHD. Control and the mutant hiPSC cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes and frozen. Frozen cell pellets were individually barcoded with the CellPlex Kit from 10X Genomics. Nuclei from the barcoded cells were extracted and then pooled at equal amount. Single Nuclei RNAsequencing library was generated using 10X Genomics platform. Nuclei were demulitplexed using reads mapping to the barcodes.},

Multi-lineage development from gastruloids is enabling unprecedented opportunities to model and study human embryonic processes and is expected to accelerate ex vivo strategies in organ development. Reproducing human cardiogenesis with neurogenesis in a multi-lineage context remains challenging, requiring spatiotemporal input of paracrine and mechanical cues. Here we extend elongating multi-lineage organized (EMLO) gastruloids to include cardiogenesis (EMLOC) and describe interconnected neuro-cardiac lineages in a single gastruloid model. Contractile EMLOCs recapitulate numerous interlinked developmental features including heart tube formation and specialization, cardiomyocyte differentiation and remodeling phases, epicardium, ventricular wall morphogenesis, chamber-like structures and formation of a putative outflow tract. The EMLOC cardiac region, which originates anterior to gut tube primordium, is progressively populated by neurons in a spatial pattern mirroring the known distribution of neurons in the innervated human heart. This human EMLOC model represents a multi-lineage advancement for the study of coincident neurogenesis and cardiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Tissue fibrosis and organ dysfunction are hallmarks of age-related diseases including heart failure, but it remains elusive whether there is a common pathway to induce both events. Through single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and genetic perturbation, we elucidate that high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) is a critical regulator of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure by maintaining the identity of quiescent cardiac fibroblasts through degrading transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$). Pressure overload downregulates expression of Htra3 in cardiac fibroblasts and activated TGF-$\beta$ signaling, which induces not only cardiac fibrosis but also heart failure through DNA damage accumulation and secretory phenotype induction in failing cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Htra3 in the heart inhibits TGF-$\beta$ signaling and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction after pressure overload. Htra3-regulated induction of spatio-temporal cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte secretory phenotype are observed specifically in infarct regions after myocardial infarction. Integrative analyses of single-cardiomyocyte transcriptome and plasma proteome in human reveal that IGFBP7, which is a cytokine downstream of TGF-$\beta$ and secreted from failing cardiomyocytes, is the most predictable marker of advanced heart failure. These findings highlight the roles of cardiac fibroblasts in regulating cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac fibrosis through the Htra3-TGF-$\beta$-IGFBP7 pathway, which would be a therapeutic target for heart failure.},

  abstract = {Abnormalities of ventricular action potential cause malignant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Here, we aim to identify microRNAs that regulate the human cardiac action potential and ask whether their manipulation allows for therapeutic modulation of action potential abnormalities. Quantitative analysis of the microRNA targetomes in human cardiac myocytes identifies miR-365 as a primary microRNA to regulate repolarizing ion channels. Action potential recordings in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes show that elevation of miR-365 significantly prolongs action potential duration in myocytes derived from a Short-QT syndrome patient, whereas specific inhibition of miR-365 normalizes pathologically prolonged action potential in Long-QT syndrome myocytes. Transcriptome analyses in these cells at bulk and single-cell level corroborate the key cardiac repolarizing channels as direct targets of miR-365, together with functionally synergistic regulation of additional action potential-regulating genes by this microRNA. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments confirm miR-365-dependent regulation of repolarizing ionic current Iks. Finally, refractory period measurements in human myocardial slices substantiate the regulatory effect of miR-365 on action potential in adult human myocardial tissue. Our results delineate miR-365 to regulate human cardiac action potential duration by targeting key factors of cardiac repolarization.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic and temporally specific gene regulatory changes may underlie unexplained genetic associations with complex disease. During a dynamic process such as cellular differentiation, the overall cell type composition of a tissue (or an in vitro culture) and the gene regulatory profile of each cell can both experience significant changes over time. To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell RNA-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic eQTLs whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic eQTLs affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk RNA-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic eQTLs in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic eQTLs can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation.},

  abstract = {Summary
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic heart disease that is characterized by unexplained segmental hypertrophy that is usually most pronounced in the septum. While sarcomeric gene mutations are often the genetic basis for HCM, the mechanistic origin for the heterogeneous remodeling remains largely unknown. A better understanding of the gene networks driving the cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy is required to improve therapeutic strategies. Patients suffering from HCM often receive a septal myectomy surgery to relieve outflow tract obstruction due to hypertrophy. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on septal myectomy samples from patients with HCM, we identify functional links between genes, transcription factors, and cell size relevant for HCM. The data show the utility of using scRNA-seq on the human hypertrophic heart, highlight CM heterogeneity, and provide a wealth of insights into molecular events involved in HCM that can eventually contribute to the development of enhanced therapies.},

  abstract = {Cellular therapy to treat heart failure is an ongoing focus of intense research, but progress toward structural and functional recovery remains modest. Engineered augmentation of established cellular effectors overcomes impediments to enhance reparative activity. Such `next generation' implementation includes delivery of combinatorial cell populations exerting synergistic effects. Concurrent isolation and expansion of three distinct cardiac-derived interstitial cell types from human heart tissue, previously reported by our group, prompted design of a 3D structure that maximizes cellular interaction, allows for defined cell ratios, controls size, enables injectability, and minimizes cell loss. Herein, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and c-Kit+ cardiac interstitial cells (cCICs) when cultured together spontaneously form scaffold-free 3D microenvironments termed CardioClusters. scRNA-Seq profiling reveals CardioCluster expression of stem cell-relevant factors, adhesion/extracellular-matrix molecules, and cytokines, while maintaining a more native transcriptome similar to endogenous cardiac cells. CardioCluster intramyocardial delivery improves cell retention and capillary density with preservation of cardiomyocyte size and long-term cardiac function in a murine infarction model followed 20 weeks. CardioCluster utilization in this preclinical setting establish fundamental insights, laying the framework for optimization in cell-based therapeutics intended to mitigate cardiomyopathic damage.},

  abstract = {Regenerative therapeutic approaches for myocardial diseases often involve delivery of stem cells expanded ex vivo. Prior studies indicate that cell culture conditions affect functional and phenotypic characteristics, but relationship(s) of cultured cells derived from freshly isolated populations and the heterogeneity of the cultured population remain poorly defined. Functional and phenotypic characteristics of ex vivo expanded cells will determine outcomes of interventional treatment for disease, necessitating characterization of the impact that ex vivo expansion has upon isolated stem cell populations. Single-cell RNA-Seq profiling (scRNA-Seq) was performed to determine consequences of culture expansion upon adult cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) as well as relationships with other cell populations. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that identity marker genes expressed in freshly isolated cells become undetectable in cultured CPCs while low level expression emerges for thousands of other genes. Transcriptional profile of CPCs exhibited greater degree of similarity throughout the cultured population relative to freshly isolated cells. Findings were validated by comparative analyses using scRNA-Seq datasets of various cell types generated by multiple scRNA-Seq technology. Increased transcriptome diversity and decreased population heterogeneity in the cultured cell population may help account for reported outcomes associated with experimental and clinical use of CPCs for treatment of myocardial injury.},

  abstract = {Inflammation and fibrosis are intertwined mechanisms fundamentally involved in heart failure. Detailed deciphering gene expression perturbations and cell--cell interactions of leukocytes and non-myocytes is required to understand cell-type-specific pathology in the failing human myocardium. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and single T cell receptor sequencing of 200,615 cells in both human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) hearts. We sampled both lesion and mild-lesion tissues from each heart to sequentially capture cellular and molecular alterations to different extents of cardiac fibrosis. By which, left (lesion) and right ventricle (mild-lesion) for DCM hearts were harvest while infarcted (lesion) and non-infarcted area (mild-lesion) were dissected from ICM hearts. A novel transcription factor AEBP1 was identified as a crucial cardiac fibrosis regulator in ACTA2+ myofibroblasts. Within fibrotic myocardium, an infiltration of a considerable number of leukocytes was witnessed, especially cytotoxic and exhausted CD8+ T cells and pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, a subset of tissue-resident macrophage, CXCL8hiCCR2+HLA-DRhi macrophage was particularly identified in severely fibrotic area, which interacted with activated endothelial cell via DARC, that potentially facilitate leukocyte recruitment and infiltration in human heart failure.},

  abstract = {Owing to the prevalence and high mortality rates of cardiac diseases, a more detailed characterization of the human heart is necessary; however, this has been largely impeded by the cellular diversity of cardiac tissue and limited access to samples. Here, we show transcriptome profiling of 21,422 single cells---including cardiomyocytes (CMs) and non-CMs (NCMs)---from normal, failed and partially recovered (left ventricular assist device treatment) adult human hearts. Comparative analysis of atrial and ventricular cells revealed pronounced inter- and intracompartmental CM heterogeneity as well as compartment-specific utilization of NCM cell types as major cell-communication hubs. Systematic analysis of cellular compositions and cell--cell interaction networks showed that CM contractility and metabolism are the most prominent aspects that are correlated with changes in heart function. We also uncovered active engagement of NCMs in regulating the behaviour of CMs, exemplified by ACKR1+-endothelial cells, injection of which preserved cardiac function after injury. Beyond serving as a rich resource, our study provides insights into cell-type-targeted intervention of heart diseases.},
