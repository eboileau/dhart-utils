# DHART utils

### Todo

- [ ] We do not want to test `pysradb`. Currently, there is not much to test, except SOFT file parsing/data wrangling. 
- [ ] We should eventually _containerize_ at least the data wrangling scripts.
  - [ ] Prepare selected/relevant upload examples for the DHART to replace existing ones.
  
- [ ] This would probably not happen if we select our datasets, but if there are no supp data, SOFT file will be downloaded, and
an error will be thrown in `get_supp_files`. We could add a check and terminate gracefully.
