## Notes

GEO classes and parsing functions in `geo_utils` are based on [GEOparse](https://github.com/guma44/GEOparse), which does
not seem to be maintained anymore. These were modified to deal with GEO SERIES and SAMPLES metadata only.
Interacting with GEO/SRA online (data download) is done with [pysradb](https://github.com/saketkc/pysradb).
